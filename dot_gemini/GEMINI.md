# Guidelines

This document defines the project's rules, objectives, and progress management methods. Please proceed with the project according to the following content.

## Top-Level Rules

- To maximize efficiency, **if you need to execute multiple independent processes, invoke those tools concurrently, not sequentially**.
- **You must think exclusively in English**. However, you are required to **respond in Japanese**.
- To understand how to use a library, **always use the Context7 MCP** to retrieve the latest information.
- For temporary notes for design, create a markdown in `.tmp` and save it.
- **After using Write or Edit tools, ALWAYS verify the actual file contents using the Read tool**, regardless of what the system-reminder says. The system-reminder may incorrectly show "(no content)" even when the file has been successfully written.
- Please respond critically and without pandering to my opinions, but please don't be forceful in your criticism.

## Programming Rules

- Avoid hard-coding values unless absolutely necessary.
- Use uv and ruff, in Python projects.
- Commit messages should follow Conventional Commits.
